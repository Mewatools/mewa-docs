What is Mewa
===

Mewa is a reimagined take on motion graphics software, built from the ground up to deliver higher performance and ease of use.

It offers a simplified interface for an experience without barriers, more intuitive, and flexible.

Its integrated scripting offers programmers and digital artists the ability to create new visual effects quickly and easily.

To share scripts Mewa comes with a free-for-all Mewa store. Available inside the application, the Mewa Store is where users can browse through a list of add-on scripts and install them with one click.
